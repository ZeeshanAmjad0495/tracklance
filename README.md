### TrackLance - CLI Task Tracker  

TrackLance is a command-line tool for managing tasks. It allows you to add, update, delete, and track the status of your tasks efficiently.  

ðŸ“Œ **Project URL:** [Task Tracker Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)  

## Features  

âœ… Add, update, and delete tasks  
âœ… Mark tasks as **in-progress** or **done**  
âœ… List all tasks or filter by status  
âœ… Stores tasks in a JSON file (`tasks.json`)  

## Installation  

### 1. Clone the Repository  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZeeshanAmjad0495/tracklance.git
cd tracklance
```

### 2. Install Development Dependencies (Optional)

```bash
npm install --save-dev
```

### 3. Set Up the CLI  

Create a runnable script:  

```bash
echo -e '#!/bin/bash\ntsx tasklance.ts "$@"' > tasklance
chmod +x tasklance
sudo mv tasklance /usr/local/bin/
```

Now you can use `tasklance` instead of running `tsx tasklance.ts`.

tasklance add "Buy groceries"

tasklance update abc123 "Buy groceries and cook dinner"
```

### Deleting a Task
